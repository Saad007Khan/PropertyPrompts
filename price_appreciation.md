## STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### For Newspaper & Consultancy Data:
```
1. Extract appreciation percentages directly from source
2. Verify time periods (YoY and/or 5Y CAGR)
3. Note source attribution
4. Cross-check against another Priority 1-3 source if possible
5. Assign confidence based on source recency and authority
6. If only YoY available, note inability to assess long-term trend
```

### For Official Index Data:
```
1. Collect index values for multiple time periods
2. Calculate Year-over-Year: [(Current Period - Prior Period) / Prior Period] × 100
3. Calculate 5-Year CAGR: [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/5)] - 1
4. Document time periods explicitly
5. Compare 5Y CAGR vs YoY to identify trend
6. Confidence: HIGH
```

**Example Official Index Calculation:**
```
Index Values:
- Q4 2019: 100.0
- Q4 2023: 115.0
- Q4 2024: 125.0

5Y CAGR = [(125/100)^(1/5)] - 1 = 4.6%
YoY = (125 - 115) / 115 × 100 = 8.7%

Interpretation: YoY (8.7%) > 5Y CAGR (4.6%) = Accelerating market
```

### For Portal Historical Analysis (Tier 2/3 Fallback):

**1. Collect Historical Listing Data (2-3 years)**
   - Gather average price per sq ft for each year
   - Use same property type (e.g., 2BHK apartments)
   - Same locality/zone for consistency

**2. Calculate Average Price Per Sq Ft**
   - Collect minimum 20-30 listings per year (if available)
   - Remove outliers (top/bottom 10%)
   - Calculate median price per sq ft

**3. Compute Year-over-Year Appreciation**

```
Formula: [(Current Year Price - Previous Year Price) / Previous Year Price] × 100

Example:
2023: ₹4,200/sqft
2024: ₹4,600/sqft
Appreciation = (4600 - 4200) / 4200 × 100 = 9.5% YoY
```

**4. Multi-Year CAGR Calculation (5-Year)**

```
5Y CAGR = [(Ending Price / Beginning Price)^(1/5)] - 1

Example:
2019: ₹3,500/sqft
2024: ₹4,600/sqft (5 years)
5Y CAGR = [(4600/3500)^(1/5)] - 1 = 5.6%

YoY:
2023: ₹4,200/sqft
2024: ₹4,600/sqft
YoY = (4600 - 4200) / 4200 × 100 = 9.5%

Interpretation: YoY (9.5%) > 5Y CAGR (5.6%) = Recent acceleration
```

**If only 1-2 years of data available:**
```
Report YoY only, mark 5Y CAGR as "Data not available"
Note in primary source: "Insufficient historical data for 5Y CAGR"
```

**5. Cross-Verify with Multiple Portals**
   - Collect data from minimum 3 portals
   - Calculate appreciation for each
   - Average the results

**Example Multi-Portal Calculation:**
```
MagicBricks: 9.5% YoY
99acres: 8.8% YoY
Housing.com: 9.2% YoY

Average Appreciation = (9.5 + 8.8 + 9.2) / 3 = 9.2% YoY
Standard Deviation = 0.4%
Report as: 9.2% ± 0.4% (8.8% - 9.6%)
```

---

### Example 7: High Variance Location

**TEXT FORMAT:**
```
Price Appreciation: Data not available (5Y CAGR) | 5.8% ± 1.2% YoY (range: 4.6% - 7.0%)
Trend: Unable to assess long-term trend

- **ALWAYS check reputable newspapers first** for all cities (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- **ALWAYS check official indices second** if available
- **ALWAYS check consultancy reports third** before portals
- **ONLY use portal method if Priorities 1-3 insufficient**

### 2. Newspaper Source Criteria
- Established financial/business publications

- Publication date critical (prefer <3 months old)
- Avoid opinion pieces without supporting data

### 3. Official Index Priority

- Display raw price data if using portals
- Show calculation formula with numbers
- Display individual portal results before averaging
- Calculate and report standard deviation
- Cite newspaper/consultancy quotes or data points

### 7. Confidence Assignment
- **HIGH**: Official government index with data <3 months old OR newspaper/consultancy from Tier 1 source <3 months old
- **MEDIUM**: 3+ portals with variance <2% OR consultancy data 3-6 months old OR newspaper article with dated data
- **LOW**: <3 portals, variance >2%, or data >6 months old, or insufficient newspaper/consultancy coverage

### 8. Handle Missing Data Honestly
- If no newspaper coverage: State "Insufficient media coverage"
- If official index unavailable: State "No official index available"
- If consultancy reports not found: State "Limited analyst coverage"
- If portal data insufficient: State "Sample size too small ([X] listings)"
- For missing time periods: Use "Data not available" in that field

### 9. Report Negative Appreciation
- Don't hide market declines
- Report as: "-3.2%" not "slow growth"
- Include negative values in both TEXT and JSON formats

### 10. Output Format Compliance
- **ALWAYS** provide both TEXT and JSON formats
- **Both formats must match exactly**
- Use "Data not available" for missing time periods
- Maintain consistent structure across all outputs
- No explanations or additional commentary in output formats

---

## TREND CLASSIFICATION

### Accelerating (Recent Surge)
- **YoY > 5Y CAGR** (significantly higher)
- Example: 4.8% 5Y CAGR | 8.5% YoY
- **Interpretation:** Short-term appreciation exceeding long-term trend = recent acceleration

### Steady
- **YoY ≈ 5Y CAGR** (within ±1%)
- Example: 2.5% 5Y CAGR | 2.8% YoY
- **Interpretation:** Consistent, stable appreciation over time

### Decelerating (Recent Slowdown)
- **YoY < 5Y CAGR** (but YoY still positive)
- Example: 7.5% 5Y CAGR | 3.2% YoY
- **Interpretation:** Short-term appreciation below long-term trend = recent deceleration

### Declining (Recent Downturn)
- **Negative YoY** appreciation
- Example: 3.8% 5Y CAGR | -1.5% YoY
- **Interpretation:** Recent price decline after period of growth

### Unable to determine
- **Only one metric available** (either 5Y CAGR or YoY, not both)
- **Insufficient data** for trend analysis
- Example: Data not available (5Y CAGR) | 6.8% YoY
- **Interpretation:** Can't assess trend without long-term comparison

**Key Insight:**
When both 5Y CAGR and YoY are available:
- **5Y CAGR** shows the long-term trend (smoothed over 5 years)
- **YoY** shows the current short-term momentum
- **Comparing them** reveals if the market is accelerating, steady, or decelerating

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Time Period Definitions:
- **5Y CAGR (5-Year Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Long-term trend over 5 years - PRIORITIZED for analysis
- **YoY (Year-over-Year):** Short-term trend comparing current period vs. same period 1 year ago

### Data Priority Logic:
1. **Ideal:** Both 5Y CAGR + YoY available → Compare to identify trend
2. **Fallback:** Only YoY available → Report YoY with note about missing long-term data
3. **Rare:** Only 5Y CAGR available → Report 5Y CAGR with note about missing short-term signal

### When Historical Data Limited:
- **If only 1-year data:** Report YoY only, mark 5Y CAGR as "Data not available"
- **If 2-4 years data:** Calculate available CAGR (2Y, 3Y, 4Y) but still mark 5Y as "Data not available"
- **If 5+ years data:** Calculate full 5Y CAGR and YoY

### Interpretation Guide:
- **YoY > 5Y CAGR:** Market accelerating (recent surge)
- **YoY ≈ 5Y CAGR:** Market steady (consistent growth)
- **YoY < 5Y CAGR:** Market decelerating (recent slowdown)
- **YoY negative:** Market declining (prices dropping)
- **Only YoY available:** Cannot assess long-term trend

### Source Priority Designation:
- **Newspaper:** Data from Priority 1 sources
- **Official Index:** Data from Priority 2 sources
- **Consultancy:** Data from Priority 3 sources
- **Portal Avg:** Data from Priority 4 sources (multi-portal average)

### Variance Reporting:
