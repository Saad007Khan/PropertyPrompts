## STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### For Newspaper & Consultancy Data:
```
1. Extract appreciation percentage directly from source
2. Verify time period (YoY, 3Y, 5Y CAGR, etc.)
3. Note source attribution
4. Cross-check against another Priority 1-3 source if possible
5. Assign confidence based on source recency and authority
```

### For Official Index Data:
```
1. Collect index values for multiple time periods
2. Calculate Year-over-Year: [(Current Period - Prior Period) / Prior Period] × 100
3. Calculate Multi-Year CAGR: [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Years)] - 1
4. Document time periods explicitly
5. Confidence: High
```

### For Portal Historical Analysis (Tier 2/3 Fallback):

**1. Collect Historical Listing Data (2-3 years)**
   - Gather average price per sq ft for each year
   - Use same property type (e.g., 2BHK apartments)
   - Same locality/zone for consistency

**2. Calculate Average Price Per Sq Ft**
   - Collect minimum 20-30 listings per year (if available)
   - Remove outliers (top/bottom 10%)
   - Calculate median price per sq ft

**3. Compute Year-over-Year Appreciation**

```
Formula: [(Current Year Price - Previous Year Price) / Previous Year Price] × 100

Example:
2023: ₹4,200/sqft
2024: ₹4,600/sqft
Appreciation = (4600 - 4200) / 4200 × 100 = 9.5% YoY
```

**4. Multi-Year CAGR Calculation**

```
CAGR = [(Ending Price / Beginning Price)^(1/Years)] - 1

Example:
2022: ₹3,800/sqft
2024: ₹4,600/sqft (2 years)
CAGR = [(4600/3800)^(1/2)] - 1 = 9.9%
```

**5. Cross-Verify with Multiple Portals**
   - Collect data from minimum 3 portals
   - Calculate appreciation for each
   - Average the results

**Example Multi-Portal Calculation:**
```
MagicBricks: 9.5% YoY
99acres: 8.8% YoY
Housing.com: 9.2% YoY

Average Appreciation = (9.5 + 8.8 + 9.2) / 3 = 9.2% YoY
Standard Deviation = 0.4%
Report as: 9.2% ± 0.4% (8.8% - 9.6%)
```
