## WRITING RULES

### 1. Be Specific, Not Generic
❌ "Great location with good amenities and investment potential"
✅ "Dubai Marina combines waterfront living with 6.8% rental yields, 15-minute metro access to DIFC, and year-round tenant demand from 21,000+ DMCC companies"

### 2. Use Concrete Numbers
- Percentages: "8-12% rental yields"
- Distances: "500m from beach", "2 metro stops to downtown"
- Growth: "28% price appreciation YoY"
- Demand: "90%+ occupancy rates"
- Scale: "10.4M annual visitors"

### 3. Lead with Strongest Attribute
**If high yields**: Start with yield percentage
**If strong growth**: Start with appreciation rate
**If unique location**: Start with lifestyle/geography
**If infrastructure**: Start with connectivity/development

### 4. Avoid Fluff Words
❌ Eliminate: "great", "excellent", "amazing", "beautiful", "nice"
✅ Use: Specific features, numbers, facts, comparables

### 5. Make It Actionable
End with clear investor profile or strategy:
- "Ideal for yield-focused investors seeking steady cash flow"
- "Perfect for expat professionals and vacation rental investors"
- "Best suited for long-term capital appreciation plays"

### 6. Keep It Concise
- **2-3 sentences maximum**
- **50-80 words total**
- Every word must earn its place

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Dubai Marina (High Yield + Lifestyle)

```
Location Highlight:

Dubai Marina delivers premium waterfront living with consistent 6.5-7% rental yields, driven by strong expat demand from 21,000+ DMCC free zone companies and year-round tourism (90%+ hotel occupancy). The location combines lifestyle appeal—3km promenade with 40+ restaurants, yacht berths, and beach access—with practical connectivity via two metro stations linking to Downtown (15 min) and DIFC (12 min). Ideal for investors seeking stable rental income with capital preservation in a tax-free, liquid market.
```

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Leads with yield (6.5-7%)
- ✅ Quantifies demand (21,000 companies, 90% occupancy)
- ✅ Specific amenities (3km promenade, 40+ restaurants)
- ✅ Transit details (15 min to Downtown)
- ✅ Clear target (stable income investors)

---

### Example 2: North Goa (Growth + Lifestyle)

```
Location Highlight:

North Goa has emerged as India's premier beach investment destination, delivering 8-12% rental yields and 28% annual price appreciation (2023-2024), fueled by post-pandemic surge in remote workers, digital nomads, and luxury tourism (10.4M visitors, +21% YoY). Properties within 1-3 km of Anjuna, Vagator, and Morjim beaches benefit from year-round demand—70-85% occupancy for vacation rentals and growing 6-12 month leases from international professionals drawn to co-working spaces and lifestyle infrastructure. Best suited for investors comfortable with seasonal income fluctuations seeking high-growth coastal markets with strong short-term rental potential.
```

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Dual appeal (8-12% yields AND 28% appreciation)
- ✅ Trend context (remote workers, digital nomads)
- ✅ Tourism data (10.4M visitors, +21%)
- ✅ Occupancy proof (70-85%)
- ✅ Clear strategy (STR potential, seasonal income)

### Example 3: Singapore (Stability + Liquidity)

```
Location Highlight:

Singapore offers institutional-grade real estate investment with unmatched stability—zero capital gains tax, 0% property crime rate, and transparent legal framework backed by top global governance rankings—though rental yields are modest at 2.5-3.5% for condos. The city-state's position as Southeast Asia's financial hub ensures consistent tenant demand from multinational corporations and expat professionals, while property values appreciate steadily at 3-5% annually with exceptional market liquidity. Ideal for high-net-worth investors prioritizing capital safety, estate planning, and portfolio diversification over maximum yield.
```

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Unique angle (stability/safety, not yield)
- ✅ Honest about yields (2.5-3.5%, not hiding it)
- ✅ Zero CGT highlighted (key advantage)
- ✅ Clear demand source (MNCs, expats)
- ✅ Perfect target (HNW, safety-focused)

### Example 4: Coimbatore, India (Emerging Market)

```
Location Highlight:

Coimbatore presents an emerging Tier-2 investment opportunity with 7-9% rental yields and entry points from ₹25-35 lakh, driven by textile industry revival, growing IT sector presence (Tidel Park expansion), and improving infrastructure (international airport, smart city projects). The city offers significantly lower entry costs than Bangalore or Chennai while maintaining similar rental demand from professionals and students (PSG, Amrita campuses), though investors should note limited luxury inventory and less developed property management ecosystem. Best for first-time investors or those seeking affordable diversification beyond saturated metro markets.
```

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Positions as "emerging" (manages expectations)
- ✅ Specific yields and entry costs (7-9%, ₹25-35L)
- ✅ Growth drivers (textile, IT, infrastructure)
- ✅ Honest about limitations (limited luxury, less PM)
- ✅ Clear target (first-time, diversification)
