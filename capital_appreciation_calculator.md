## WHAT IS CAPITAL APPRECIATION?

Capital appreciation represents the increase in property value over time, expressed as a percentage. For real estate investors, this is the primary metric for evaluating long-term investment returns (excluding rental income).

**Key Distinction:**
- **Price Appreciation**: Market-wide property price growth
- **Capital Appreciation**: Investor-specific return on property value increase

For most analyses, these are identical, but capital appreciation may factor in:
- Purchase price vs current market value
- Property-specific improvements/depreciation
- Segment-specific performance (luxury vs mid-range)
- Location micro-market variations

## CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### Method 1: From Official Indices (Highest Confidence)

```
Year-over-Year Appreciation:
Formula: [(Current Index - Previous Index) / Previous Index] × 100

Example (NHB RESIDEX):
Q3 2024: 285.4
Q3 2023: 265.8
YoY = (285.4 - 265.8) / 265.8 × 100 = 7.4%

Multi-Year CAGR:
Formula: [(Ending Index / Beginning Index)^(1/Years)] - 1

Example:
Q3 2021: 235.0
Q3 2024: 285.4 (3 years)
CAGR = [(285.4/235.0)^(1/3)] - 1 = 6.7%
```

### Method 2: From News/Consultancy Reports

```
1. Extract appreciation percentage directly from source
2. Note time period (YoY, 3Y CAGR, 5Y CAGR, etc.)
3. Document source and publication date
4. Cross-verify with another Priority 1-3 source if possible
5. For investment-specific data, note property segment
```

### Method 3: From Portal Historical Data (Tier 2/3 Fallback)

```
1. Collect Historical Data (minimum 2-3 years)
   - Average price per sq ft for each year
   - Same property type (2BHK apartments, villas, etc.)
   - Same locality/micro-market

2. Calculate Median Price
   - Minimum 20-30 listings per year per portal
   - Remove outliers (top/bottom 10%)
   - Use median, not mean

3. Calculate Appreciation
   YoY: [(Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year] × 100
   CAGR: [(Ending Price / Beginning Price)^(1/Years)] - 1

4. Multi-Portal Averaging
   - Calculate appreciation for each portal
   - Average the results
   - Calculate standard deviation
   - Report as: Average ± StdDev (Range)

Example:
Portal A: 8.5% YoY
Portal B: 7.8% YoY
Portal C: 8.2% YoY
Average: 8.2% ± 0.4% (7.8% - 8.5%)
```

## INVESTMENT-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Property Segment Differences
- **Luxury properties** (top 10% by price): Often lower appreciation, higher volatility
- **Mid-range properties** (₹50L-₹2Cr in India): Typically highest appreciation, most liquid
- **Affordable properties** (<₹50L in India): Variable appreciation, policy-dependent

### Location Variations
- **City center**: Lower appreciation, premium pricing
- **Suburbs**: Higher appreciation potential, infrastructure-dependent
- **Emerging areas**: Highest appreciation but higher risk

### Investment Horizon Impact
- **1-3 years**: Subject to market cycles, higher volatility
- **5-7 years**: Smoothed returns, medium confidence
- **10+ years**: Historical average, high confidence
