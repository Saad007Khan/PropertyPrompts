## CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### Method 1: From Vacation Rental Platforms (Highest Accuracy)

```
Step 1: Collect Comparable Listings
- Same location (specific area/beach/neighborhood)
- Same property type (villa, apartment, studio)
- Same size (2 BHK, 3 BHK, etc.)
- "Entire place" category only
- Minimum 15-20 listings

Step 2: Check Pricing Calendar
For each listing:
- Note peak season daily rate (check Dec-Jan dates)
- Note off-season daily rate (check monsoon months)
- Check if weekly/monthly discounts applied
- Note any minimum night requirements

Step 3: Calculate Median Rates
Remove outliers (top/bottom 10%)
Calculate median (not average) for:
- Peak season daily rate
- Off season daily rate

Step 4: Cross-Platform Verification
Repeat for minimum 2-3 platforms:
- Airbnb
- Booking.com
- Vrbo/Local platforms

Step 5: Final Calculation
Average the median rates across platforms
Report as range if variance is high

Example (3 BHK Villa, North Goa):

Airbnb (20 listings):
Peak: ₹8,000, ₹8,500, ₹9,000... → Median: ₹8,500
Off: ₹3,500, ₹3,800, ₹4,000... → Median: ₹3,800

Booking.com (15 listings):
Peak: ₹8,200, ₹8,800, ₹9,200... → Median: ₹8,600
Off: ₹3,600, ₹3,900, ₹4,100... → Median: ₹3,900

Vrbo (12 listings):
Peak: ₹8,300, ₹8,700, ₹9,100... → Median: ₹8,500
Off: ₹3,700, ₹4,000, ₹4,200... → Median: ₹3,950

Final Result:
Peak: (8,500 + 8,600 + 8,500) / 3 = ₹8,533 → Round to ₹8,500
Off: (3,800 + 3,900 + 3,950) / 3 = ₹3,883 → Round to ₹3,900

Report: 
Revenue (Peak): ₹8,500
Revenue (Off Season): ₹3,900
```

### Method 2: From Rental Intelligence Reports

```
1. Extract rental rates from AirDNA, Transparent, or consultancy reports
2. Note property type and location specificity
3. Verify peak vs off-season breakdown
4. Check report date (prefer <6 months old)
5. Cross-verify with at least one other source
```

### Method 3: From Property Management Companies

```
1. Collect rate cards from local property managers
2. Request seasonal pricing breakdown
3. Verify with actual platform listings
4. Note management fees included/excluded
5. Adjust for owner vs guest pricing
```

## OCCUPANCY RATE ESTIMATION

**Use for Annual Revenue Calculation:**

```
Annual Rental Income = (Peak Days × Peak Rate × Peak Occupancy%) + 
                       (Off Days × Off Rate × Off Occupancy%)

Typical Occupancy Rates (Short-term Vacation Rentals):

HIGH DEMAND LOCATIONS (Goa, Phuket, Dubai):
- Peak Season: 70-85% occupancy
- Off Season: 25-40% occupancy

MEDIUM DEMAND (Hill Stations, City Outskirts):
- Peak Season: 60-75% occupancy
- Off Season: 20-35% occupancy

LOW DEMAND (Emerging Destinations):
- Peak Season: 50-65% occupancy
- Off Season: 15-25% occupancy

Sources for Occupancy Data:
1. AirDNA reports (location-specific)
2. Tourism board hotel occupancy (proxy)
3. Property management company estimates
4. Consultancy reports

Example Calculation (Goa 3 BHK Villa):
Peak Days: 120 days (Nov-Feb: 4 months)
Off Days: 245 days (8 months)

Peak Revenue: 120 × ₹8,500 × 75% = ₹7,65,000
Off Revenue: 245 × ₹3,800 × 30% = ₹2,79,300
Annual Gross: ₹10,44,300

If property value: ₹1.2 Cr
Gross Rental Yield: (10,44,300 / 1,20,00,000) × 100 = 8.7%

## CRITICAL RULES

### 1. Platform Data Priority (Tourist Destinations)
- **ALWAYS check Airbnb first** for vacation rentals
- **ALWAYS check Booking.com second**
- **ALWAYS check local platforms third** (Vrbo, regional)
- **Use actual listing data**, not just averages

### 2. Comparable Property Selection
- **Same location** (specific beach/neighborhood, not just city)
- **Same property type** (villa vs apartment matters)
- **Same size** (2 BHK vs 3 BHK significant difference)
- **"Entire place"** only (not shared rooms)
- **Similar amenities** (pool, modern, sea view)

### 3. Seasonal Rate Identification
- **Check actual calendar pricing** on platforms
- **Peak season**: Book specific dates to see rates
- **Off season**: Check monsoon/low-demand month rates
- **Verify with minimum 10-15 listings** per season

### 4. Remove Outliers
- **Top 10% removal**: Ultra-luxury properties
- **Bottom 10% removal**: Budget/poor quality properties
- **Use median, not mean**: More accurate for rental data
- **Flag high variance**: If range >40%, note uncertainty

### 5. Multi-Platform Verification
- **Minimum 2 platforms required** (prefer 3)
- **Calculate separately then average**
- **Report variance if >15%**
- **Flag platform differences** (Airbnb vs Booking.com)

### 6. Occupancy Rate Transparency
- **Never assume 100% occupancy**
- **Use conservative estimates** (70% peak, 30% off is aggressive)
- **Cite source for occupancy** (AirDNA, tourism data, estimates)
- **Provide occupancy range** if uncertain

### 7. Calculation Transparency
- **Show platform-by-platform data**
- **Show outlier removal process**
- **Show median calculation**
- **Show final averaging method**
- **Include sample size for each platform**

### 8. Confidence Assignment
- **High**: 15+ listings per platform, 3+ platforms, clear seasonal patterns, data <3 months old
- **Medium**: 10-14 listings per platform, 2 platforms, reasonable patterns, data 3-6 months old
- **Low**: <10 listings, single platform, unclear patterns, or data >6 months old

### 9. Currency & Unit Clarity
- **Always specify currency** (₹ for India, $ for US, AED for UAE)
- **Always specify unit** (per day, per night, per month)
- **Provide USD equivalent** for international investors
- **Note if rates include taxes** or are before taxes

### 10. Handle Insufficient Data
- If <5 comparable listings: State "Insufficient comparable data"
- If no clear seasonal pattern: State "Limited seasonal variation data"
- If only long-term rentals available: State "Short-term rental data unavailable"
- Never fabricate rates

### 11. Property Type Specificity
- **Villa rates ≠ Apartment rates** (often 30-50% different)
- **2 BHK ≠ 3 BHK** (often 40-60% different)
- **Beachfront ≠ Non-beachfront** (often 50-100% different)
- **Always specify exact property type in output**

### 12. Festival/Event Premiums
- **Note special event rates** separately (Christmas, New Year)
- **Don't include ultra-premium dates** in regular peak average
- **Mention event impact** in detailed analysis
- **Flag minimum night requirements** for events

### 13. Long-term vs Short-term
- **Monthly rates** ≠ (Daily rate × 30) - typically 40-60% discount
- **If only monthly data available**, clearly state this
- **Don't extrapolate** short-term from long-term or vice versa
- **Specify rental model** in output

### 14. Management Fees & Expenses
- **Note if rates are gross** (before expenses)
- **Typical expense assumption**: 20-30% (management, maintenance, taxes)
- **Don't provide net yield** unless expenses explicitly known
- **Flag expense assumptions** clearly

### 15. Output Format Compliance
- **ALWAYS** provide all three outputs in chat (simplified text, JSON, detailed analysis)
- **NO file creation required**
- Simplified output format: 
  - Revenue (Peak): ₹X,XXX
  - Revenue (Off Season): ₹X,XXX
  - Confidence: High/Medium/Low
